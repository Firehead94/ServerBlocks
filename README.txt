ServerBlocks
============
##Whats it do?

So far, it protects blocks within the range of the protection stone. There is no way to add players to the whitelist yet but the person who places the block is the default owner and shouldn't have any troubles accessing blocks within the protected area.

##TO DO

-- White list functionality
-- No overlapping fields unless owner is the same
-- Resize fields? (maybe, should be too hard I think)
-- Add Trade Stations (Items and Energy)
-- Finish adding coins
-- Other stuff.... probably

About Me
========

This is my first "public" mod. You can find my actual first mod in some obscure custom 1.4.7 modpack someplace in the internet archives. Alls it did was add a single use to tungsten ore. After that, in 1.5, I started a protection stones mod that added 3 block to the game that were used in conjunction with PreciousStones (bukkit plugin). Now I have decided to make it more independent from the plugin and make them do something. So, as a result, this will be my first non-useless mod (tehe). If you are a mod-maker/java programmer, feel free to suggest better ways of doing something or ways to clean up my code a bit. I learned Java from VSWE's crash course and a few basic classes in my community college.
